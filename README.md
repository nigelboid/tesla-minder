TeslaRequest class and scripts for monitoring Tesla cars

I have not documented the API or the scripts, yet. This is a work in progress which will ultimately incorporate real-time electricity pricing from ComEd for selective charging during low-price periods.

- Read the example scripts
- Read the TeslaRequest code
- Feel free to send me a message with questions and requests

Thanks to Greg Glockner and Tim Dorr for inspiration.
